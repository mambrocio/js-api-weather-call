## Requirement

### User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## My Approach 

I decided to sylistially make the website reminiscent of the 90's internet and the old weather channel aesthetic. I also added background music to it. 

## Success 

I mananged to use the api and fetch the weather 

# Missing

Failed to implement the local storage functionality and responsiveness.

I wanted to implement a ENTER key press event but for some reason that did not function.
